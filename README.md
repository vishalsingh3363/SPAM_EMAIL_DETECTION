# SPAM_EMAIL_DETECTION

This data science project on detecting spam messages. We will first build a model using pandas, NLTK and Naive Bayes, we took the dataset from kaggle. Then we will build an app using streamlit. During model building covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, standard scaling and data preprocessing. Technology and tools wise this project covers :-

- Python
- Pandas and NLTK for data cleaning.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- TfidfVectorizer to vectorize text documents, i.e. transform sentences into arrays of numbers.
- Sklearn for model building.
- Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE.
- Streamlit for creating web app.
- Heroku platform for deployment.
